# Dashboard
The dashboard serves as the controller for [machines](./machine.md) as well as an interface for users. Thus it can be seen as the brains of IJO. The dashboard acts as maximal node of a hierarchical tree structure, where all lower nodes are machine instances. This makes it possible for machines to, using containerization, run in other machines.
