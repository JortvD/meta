# User
A user is as the name implies a user using IJO. Most probable is that the user is using the [dashboard](./dashboard.md), but using the [machines](./machine.md) directly is also not excluded. 

## Permissions
A user can be the administrative user, able to access all parts of the dashboard, or a user with more limited permissions. This way IJO can be used by small hosters that can give the customers access to their own (restricted) machines for example.

## Roles
A role is a set of permissions created by the administrative user. Roles can then be assigned to users to easily assign groups of permissions to users.
